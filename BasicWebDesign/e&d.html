    <p> So you have a base garment. What now? Now, you have complete creative liberty to do whatever you wish. If you want to leave it simple, leave it simple! If you want to become a human disco ball, become a human disco ball! There are many types of embellishment. My favorite is embroidery, the use of different colored thick thread to create a pattern or picture. Another one of my favorites is applique, which is when you take a piece of a different fabric (most often lace), and apply it to the garment. The easiest and most common way to make your project exciting and fun is to use a pre-embellished fabric. Textiles with bright or sparkly patterns are especially eye-catching. Another interesting way you can add intrigue is through layering fabric. I prefer to use a solid base fabric, then to add a sheer overlay.  </p>

    <p> These practices can be very time-consuming. If you see a highly adorned piece, know that a lot of effort, time and love went into creating it. Some of the most illustrious couture houses create items that can take up to 7,500 hours. That's over two <em>years</em> of work spent on just one dress! There is a reason highly decorated garments are so expensive. In fact, the worldwide embroidery market is valued at almost three billion dollars, with millions of employees working hard. </p>
