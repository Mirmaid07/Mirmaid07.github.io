      <p> Patternmaking is taking the measurements of a person's body, and being able to create a draft of the pieces needed. Draping is putting scrap fabric directly onto a person's body or a dress form(mannequin), and being able to make a pattern from that. I have found both of these methods to be fun and rewarding, but sometimes they can be a bit frustrating. </p>
      <p> For both patternmaking and draping, the end result is a paper pattern. The process to get to there is different. With patternmaking by drafting, you are working with two dimensional paper to create someting that must fit a three dimensional object that moves and breathes, with only your measurements, a ruler and a pencil. With draping, you are able to put the two dimensional fabric directly onto the body, and observe and manipulate the way it hangs off or hugs it. I personally found draping to be much easier when I first started, and I still do. However, I think that drafting is a more accurate and reproducable, and all it takes is practice! </p>

      <p> The easiest way to start off the draftnig process is to have a clear idea of what you are making. If it is a garment, determine waistline placement, armhole and strap configuration neckline design and any other details. These can always be changed, but it's a good plan to have at least a baseline. If it is not, plan out the dimensions and general shape of the creation. Then, gather your supplies. For drafting, I prefer to use a stiff paper, such as the thick paper bags from a store. I like to use a good black or blue pen, but if I don't have an exact idea of what I want, I will use a pencil. It is important to use a good straight ruler, I prefer the wood ones or a clear one I can easily see through to measure against other markings. Another important tool is the French ruler, it helps to round out neck and armholes.  </p>
