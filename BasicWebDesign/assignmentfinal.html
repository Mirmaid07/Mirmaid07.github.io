    <h3> Introduction </h3>
    <p> When you walk into a mall, you would expect to see stores filled to bursting with clothes in all forms, colors and sizes. But how are they made, and do you have the skills it takes to make a garment? </p>
    <p> For as long as there has been people, we've been sewing. Traditionally, this was the role of the women of the household, but now sewing is a hobby available to anyone. I say hobby, because in the age we live in, it is not necessary to make clothes ourselves. This allows for a more extravagant and liesurely approach to the methods and practices used for thousands of years. Sewing has also been made much faster and easier through the use of technology such as sewing machines and sergers. </p>
