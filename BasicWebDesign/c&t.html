  <p> Now comes the fun part! This is always one of my favorite parts, but it's also nervewracking. You've done all this work and spent a lot of time and money on your fabric choice, so how do you ensure you don't mess it up? My advice is to always cut a little larger than you think you need. You can always cut extra fabric away, but it is difficult to add fabric back to it. </p>

  <p> When preparing to cut into your fabric, it is best to know a little bit about thread direction. If you look at a piece of fabric up close, you will notice that there are threads going up and down, and threads that run left and right. The vertical threads are called the "warp" and the horizontal are called "weft". When you lay down your pattern pieces, you want to make sure to cut at a right angle from either. If you don't, you will run into a problem with the thread-line called the bias. The bias is a forty-five degree angle from the warp and weft, and allows for stretching of the fabric. This can be helpful in some instances, but when cut unintentionally, causes weird stretching and bubbling in the garment. </p>
  <p> After identifying the orientation of your fabric, determine how many of each pattern piece you will need. If you need two, or four, or eight of each piece, feel free to fold the fabric in half, quarters, or eighths. Then arrange the pieces so you have a little extra space around all of them. Sometimes this can be difficult, but don't give up! Once you have it in a way you are satisfied with, pin the pattern to the fabric, making sure there are no wrinkles. Now you're ready for the big moment.</p>

  <p> When cutting fabric, you have a few options of cutting tools that would be easiest. The one most often thought of is scissors, and this is a good option, but may struggle with thicker fabrics. Another choice very similar to but stronger than scissors is shears. They sound intimidating, but they are just better able to cut through more layers, due to the rounded edge of the bottom prong. The next choice is one that people either love, or despise.  </p>
