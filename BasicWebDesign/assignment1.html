                <h2> Wednesday </h2>
                <p> Seeing as this week will soon be half over, it would be logical to expect a change in the weather. The past few days have been mild and full of sunshine, to the delight of many Michiganders. One states : <q> I can feel the spring in the air, it makes me so excited for summer!</q></p>
                <p> We will have to wait a <em> while </em> for that, but the temperatures continue to warm, the highs reaching the mid-40s. There will be mixed clouds and spotty sunshine, but no precipitation. Wednesday night leads to a drop back into the 30s. </p>

                <h3> Thursday</h3>
                <p> Thursday temperatures could potentially break the current record of 56 degrees. It will be overcast all day, with little to no sun. The wind will pick up in the afternoon, and there could be a chance of light showers Thursday night. Sad to see the sun go, but as they say, <q>April showers bring May flowers!</q> </p>
